# Hey! Thanks for visiting 


I'm a friendly and ambitious guy who is passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on society. As a computer systems developer, I have a keen interest in exploring the endless possibilities that technology has to offer.

My specialty is medical informatics, but I have extensive knowledge in commercial automation as well :D

When I'm not immersed in IT work, I enjoy keeping my programming skills sharp with programming-languages such as POSTGRES and C++. I also love to unwind by playing computer games. Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a love for the outdoors, and you might find me going for walks in nature or spending quality time with my friends.


*Please write to me in English or Brazilian Portuguese. These are the two languages ​​I know how to speak*
